# MeldMC

**Development Paused:** Unfortunately due to real-life things I will not be able to continue this project further until December 2026. If you wish it progresses faster you are welcome to submit a pull request (see [issues](https://github.com/Coosanta17/MeldMC/issues)).

## Features:
- Gets server version and loader information
- Loads server mod information
- Download server mods and launch Minecraft (forge 1.20.1 only)
- Minecraft-style GUI.

This will be updated once the project is more functional. See issues for steps to completion.

## How to use

is in early development. Most features not complete. 

Server-side only compatible with Minecraft Forge 1.20.1 however most other recent Minecraft versions will be made on v1.0 release. 

See https://github.com/Coosanta17/MeldMC-Server for minecraft mod. 

Install from v1.1 of installer here: https://github.com/Coosanta17/MeldMC-Installer/releases/tag/v1.1.
